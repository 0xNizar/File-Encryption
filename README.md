# File Encryption

A program that encrypts and decrypts text files using basic encryption algorithms like XOR or Caesar cipher.

TODO: 
- Add support for more advanced encryption algorithms (like AES or RSA),
- Improve security with proper key management
- Allow the program to handle multiple file types or even folders.
